        <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>Progressive enchantment is a design philosophy that is layerd with html, css, then scripting. Also, progressive enchantment is unique in the sence it is really flexable. 
        It is content first and can adjust itself based on technological demands or user preferance. For example it makes it caplable for people who can't run scripting, or who doesn't 
        want to see it, to still be able ti see the content and stylization. It also does this with if people want to veiw just the content. The best reason i came up with for progressive 
        enchantments inportance in modern web building is its ability to adapt. This makes it where in the ever evolving entity known as the internet, web pages can still be ran on
        browsers dispite not being advanced enough for the time.</p>
