        <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>Progressive enchantment is a design philosophy that is layerd with html, css, then scripting. Also, progressive enchantment is unique in the sence it is really flexable. 
        It is content first and can adjust itself based on technological demands or user preferance. For example it makes it caplable for people who can't run scripting, or who doesn't 
        want to see it, to still be able ti see the content and stylization. It also does this with if people want to veiw just the content. The best reason i came up with for progressive 
        enchantments inportance in modern web building is its ability to adapt. This makes it where in the ever evolving entity known as the internet, web pages can still be ran on
        browsers dispite not being advanced enough for the time.</p>

        <h2>Dragon Reflection and Revision</h2>
        <p>The revision I had to do for my project was simple, and they all made sense, so I went and added them.
        I made the title link an image and added a contact link to my school email in the navigation tab.
        Then I reused a previous java lab with updated CSS to give the site some flare. I would've liked to 
        figure out how to make the content layout smoother, but I am satisfied with the turnout. Overall I think 
        it was a successful project, even with the handicap I gave myself.</p>
        <p>The major takeaway I learned about this whole project was to not get overwhelmed.
        The time I could have used to sit down and get it done, I got overwhelmed and shut down. 
        Honestly looking back, I knew everything for the most part anyway, so it was a waste. 
        After finishing my first version and adding simple fixes to my revision I realized how 
        childish I was acting. I need to take a further look into my work style and stress management going forward.</p>
        <p>For the class, I appreciate it. I am personally going into Computer Science with a focus on Game Design. 
        Even so, this class was enjoyable with great content and an even greater teacher. 
        Although, when I had to apply all the information, I cracked. It felt like I was wasting time 
        learning something I will just forget a few years later. This concept is what I think college is about. 
        You find the things you like and do not. Saying this, I agree this class is fantastic, especially 
        for those who are even remotely interested.</p>
